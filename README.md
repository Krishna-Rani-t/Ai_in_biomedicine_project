RNA-to-Protein Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting protein expression from RNA data using a variety of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. The models aim to map gene expression levels to corresponding protein levels by training on single-cell multiomics data.


Training
To train the models, run the following commands in the terminal:

Training the Ridge Regression Model:
python Ridge_Regression.py

Training the Random Forest Model:
python Random_Forest.py

Training the Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN):
python Neural_network.py

Training the Autoencoder-Based Model:
python Encoder_Decoder.py

Training the SCGPT + Neural Network Model:
python rnatoprotein.py
